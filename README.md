Spreadsheet Web Application
Overview
This project is a browser-based spreadsheet application designed to emulate the core functionalities of Google Sheets. The application provides a visually intuitive interface with tools for data entry, formatting, and computation. It includes mathematical and data quality functions, dynamic cell updates, and basic formatting features, ensuring an interactive and efficient spreadsheet experience.

Key Technologies
HTML5: Provides the structural foundation for the web application.
CSS3: Styles the user interface, including the grid layout, toolbar, and formula bar.
JavaScript: Implements the core logic for managing spreadsheet data, interactions, and formula computations.
Math.js: Enables mathematical computations and formula parsing with precision.
Functions Implemented
Mathematical Functions
SUM: Calculates the sum of a range of cells.
AVERAGE: Computes the average of a range of cells.
MIN: Finds the smallest value in a range.
MAX: Finds the largest value in a range.
COUNT: Counts the number of numerical entries in a range.
Data Quality Functions
TRIM: Removes leading and trailing whitespaces from text in a cell.
UPPER: Converts cell text to uppercase.
LOWER: Converts cell text to lowercase.
REMOVE_DUPLICATES: Eliminates duplicate rows from a selected range.
FIND_AND_REPLACE: Finds specific text and replaces it across the range.
Dynamic Updates
Cell Dependencies: Ensures dependent cells update dynamically when referenced cells change.
Formulas: Supports relative and absolute references with live recalculations.
User Interface Features
Toolbar: Allows quick access to formatting tools like bold, italics, font size, and color changes.
Formula Bar: Enables users to input and modify formulas with real-time results.
Grid Interaction: Supports cell selection, resizing of rows and columns, and deletion or addition of rows/columns.
Conclusion
The Spreadsheet Web Application delivers a lightweight, browser-based alternative to Google Sheets with essential spreadsheet functionalities. The implementation demonstrates modular and scalable code, enabling future enhancements like persistent storage, data visualization (charts and graphs), and advanced formula support. The project showcases the effective use of modern web technologies to create a user-friendly and functional spreadsheet tool.
